## Functionalities
#### Image Encyption
- The Linear Feedback Shift Register Algorithm will be used to encrypt images

#### Image Decryption (TBD)

#### Image Compression
- The Huffman encoding algorithm will be used to compress images

#### Image Decompression
- We will reverse the Huffman encoding to decompress images

## Classes
### ImageOperations Class
Contains common image operations

- `GetHeight()`
- `GetWidth()`
- `OpenImage()`
- `SaveImage()`

### Compression Class
Contains all utilities for compressing and decompressing images

- `CompressImage()`
- `DecompressImage()`

### Encryption Class
Contains all utilities for encrypting and decrypting images

## User Interface
The application will have a simple form GUI, where the user can perform desired operations on images and visualize the output.

## Benchmarking
Benchmarks will be used to find and evalute the compression ratio
